# Example Contributing Guidelines

ezAlign is an open source project. We welcome contributions via pull requests as well as questions, feature requests, or bug reports via issues. Contact our team at [bernardi1@llnl.gov](mailto:bernard1@llnl.gov) with any questions. Please also refer to our [code of conduct](https://github.com/LLNL/.github/tree/master/community-health/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

If you aren't an ezAlign developer at LLNL, you won't have permission to push new branches to the repository. First, you should create a fork. This will create your copy of the ezAlign repository and ensure you can push your changes up to GitHub and create PRs. ezAlign uses Travis for continuous integration tests. Our tests are automatically run against every new PR, and passing all tests is a requirement for merging your PR.

* Create your branches off the `repo:main` branch.
* Clearly name your branches, commits, and PRs as this will help us manage queued work in a timely manner.
* Articulate your commit messages in the imperative (e.g., `Adds new privacy policy link to README`).
* Commit your work in logically organized commits, and group commits together logically in a PR.
* Title each PR clearly and give it an unambiguous description.
* Review existing issues before opening a new one. Your issue might already be under development or discussed by others. Feel free to add to any outstanding issue/bug.
* Be explicit when opening issues and reporting bugs. What behavior are you expecting? What is your justification or use case for the new feature/enhancement? How can the bug be recreated? What are any environment variables to consider?
